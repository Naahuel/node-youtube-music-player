# A YouTube audio player for the terminal using Node and MPV
This is a simple and not-at-all elegant attempt at a Music Player using node and mpv.
I made this for personal use so it's not very well made, but it works nice. 

I use it on my Raspberry Pi 3 to play music. Connect via ssh, install it on your Raspberry Pi and then run it.

## Requirements
- `node`: install Node via `nvm`: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
- `mpv`: install it via your Linux distribution's package manager
- `youtube-dl`: `mpv` requires this to play YouTube videos. Install it via `pip3`
